## Compile sources
In order to compile the Java classes and resources and include the full 
dependency list, you need to have the maven framework installed.

You don't have it? 
- Download it here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- [WIN] Add the enviromental variables following this guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_environment_setup.htm


Once you have maven installed, navigate to the project home directory (whereas
the POM.xml file is located) and execute the following commands:
```
- mvn clean     (to clean previously compilation leftovers)
- mvn package   (to build the new version of the project)
```
You can also run a one line command, just like that:
```
- mvn clean package (to clean and then build the package)
```
A new folder called "**target**" will be created in the project home directory,
inside it you will find the jar file, which already includes the project dependencies.
